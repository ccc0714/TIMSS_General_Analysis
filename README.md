# How much homework is too much 

## Study Introduction 

The TIMSS study collects information about school math and science achievement around the world, alongside a wealth of information about students, schools, and classroom practices. A recent analysis of the [Irish TIMSS data by Nathan McJames](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2024.101968) suggests short daily homework is best for mathematics achievement.  This analysis uses Bayesian Causal Forests to account for both treatment heterogeneity and propensity to end up in the treatment group. We will repeat this analysis for the 2023 and 2019 NZ data, and also think about how it can/should be modified to be most relevant in the New Zealand context. 

## Data Source

Data for the 2023 TIMSS data can be found [here](https://timss2019.org/international-database/) and data for the 2019 TIMSS data can be found [here](https://timss2023.org/data/).
